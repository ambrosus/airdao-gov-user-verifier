# AirDAO-Gov-User-Verifier

## Description

### User Verifier

User Verifier service provides an endpoint `/verify` which allows to verify if the response acquired from Fractal by using their user uniqueness check is valid and eligible to mint Human SBT. It responses with an encoded and signed Human SBT request to be used with Human SBT issuer smart contract call `sbtMint`.

### Gov Portal Mocker

Mocker for Gov Portal web app which allows user to check their uniqueness with Fractal identity system and verify the response with User Verifier service.
